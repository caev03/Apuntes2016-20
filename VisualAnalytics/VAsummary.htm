            ## Visualization (vis)

            Computer-based visualization that provides visual representation of datasets designed to help people carry out tasks more effectively  
            * The vis designar must have into account three different kinds of resourses limitation:
              * Human
              * Computer-related
              * Display  


            * The vis designer must have into account that the human is the focus of the vis  


            * Vis allows for:
              * Long term use for end users
              * Presentation of known results
              * Stepping stone to better understanding of requierements before developing models


            * Allows to replace cognition with perception e.g. tables into graphics  


            * Computer gives some advantages to vis given that computer has:
              * Beyond human Patience
              * Scale to large database
              * Supports interactivity

            ## Idioms  
            Distinct approach to creating or manipulating visual representation

            ## **_Visualitation --> Computer + Visual + Data + Human + Task_**


            The visual analytics framework is build with 3 principal parts:
            * **_What_** is shown ? ( **data** abstraction )
            * **_Why_** is the user looking at it ? ( **task** abstraction )
            * **_How_** is it shown ? ( **idiom:** visual encoding )

            ### _WHAT_
            ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caev03/Apuntes2016-20/master/VisualAnalytics/What_table.JPG)

            ##### Special DatasetTypes
            * Fields:
              * Continuos, Sampled, e.q. Brain Scan
            ##### Attribute Types
            * Categorical  
              Clasification without explicit order
            * Ordered
              * Ordinal  
                Clasification with explicit order but does not use numbers
              * Quantitative  
                Clasification with explicit order but does use numbers

            ### _WHY_
            ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caev03/Apuntes2016-20/master/VisualAnalytics/Why_table.PNG)

            ### _HOW_
            ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caev03/Apuntes2016-20/master/VisualAnalytics/How_table.PNG)

            ## Marks
            Geometric primitives
            * Points
            * Lines
            * Areas

            ### Channels
             Control appearence of marks, can reduntantly code with multiple channels
            ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caev03/Apuntes2016-20/master/VisualAnalytics/channels.PNG)
            ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caev03/Apuntes2016-20/master/VisualAnalytics/channels_expressiveness_effectiveness.PNG)

            ### Expressiveness
            * Visual encoding should express all of, and only, the information in the dataset
            * Ordered data should be shown in a way we perceive as ordered
            * Match channel and data characteristics

            ### Effectiveness
            Encode most importany attributes with highest ranked channels

            ### Perception
            * It is the organization, identification and interpretation of **sensory information** in order to represent and understand the enviorenment

            ### Cognition
            * it is the process by wich the sensory input is transformed, reduced, elaborated, stored, recovered and use

            ### Rules of Thumb
            * No unjustified 3D
              * Danger of depth
              * Occlusion
              * Perspective distortion loses information
              * Tilted text isn't legible
            * Eyes beat memory
            * Resolution over immersion
