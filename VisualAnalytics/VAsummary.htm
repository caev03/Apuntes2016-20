            ## Visualization (vis)

            Computer-based visualization that provides visual representation of datasets designed to help people carry out tasks more effectively  
            * The vis designar must have into account three different kinds of resourses limitation:
              * Human
              * Computer-related
              * Display  


            * The vis designer must have into account that the human is the focus of the vis  


            * Vis allows for:
              * Long term use for end users
              * Presentation of known results
              * Stepping stone to better understanding of requierements before developing models


            * Allows to replace cognition with perception e.g. tables into graphics  


            * Computer gives some advantages to vis given that computer has:
              * Beyond human Patience
              * Scale to large database
              * Supports interactivity
